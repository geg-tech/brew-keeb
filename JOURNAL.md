## 10/4/2025 - Making sketches n stuff  

wowowowow first (actual) entry of blueprint

Today marks the first journal in my dream keyboard! I have many ideas in mind for blueprint, including a tiny battle bot and a monster can launcher, but i'm lazy and school n stuff so this will do for now

I plan the keyboard to be a 75% layout since I don't want a keyboard that's absolutely massive, but also do want a function bar on top. I also want the keyboard to be spaced kinda like the keeb on the top (in the picture below), but also not waste a bunch of empty space trying to fit microcontrollers, screens, etc.

* tl;dr, layout like 75% keeb but without excessive space on the outside

I also (stole) acquired a ton of screws and standoffs from my robotics class, so I also plan on integrating them into the design. 
* My main plan is to somehow integrate the aluminum standoffs into the feet/case of the keeb, with maybe having the top shell or plate be attached with the screws and standoffs
* I'm mainly inspired by Logan Peterson's [keyboard](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/Riptide) which has really clean brass standoffs on the side and some type of clear acrylic
