## 10/4/2025 - Making sketches n stuff  

wowowowow first (actual) entry of blueprint

Today marks the first journal in my dream keyboard! I have many ideas in mind for blueprint, including a tiny battle bot and a monster can launcher, but i'm lazy and school n stuff so this will do for now

I plan the keyboard to be a 75% layout since I don't want a keyboard that's absolutely massive, but also do want a function bar on top. I also want the keyboard to be spaced kinda like the keeb on the top (in the picture below), but also not waste a bunch of empty space trying to fit microcontrollers, screens, etc.

* tl;dr, layout like 75% keeb but without excessive space on the outside

I also (stole) acquired a ton of screws and standoffs from my robotics class, so I also plan on integrating them into the design. 
* My main plan is to somehow integrate the aluminum standoffs into the feet/case of the keeb, with maybe having the top shell or plate be attached with the screws and standoffs
* I'm mainly inspired by Logan Peterson's [keyboard](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/Riptide) which has really clean brass standoffs on the side and some type of clear acrylic

## 10/6/2025 - Planning Parts (ill do the actual schematic later fr fr)  

Today I worked on the schematic for the keyboard.
I mainly want the microcontroller to be a RP2040 Raspberry Pi Pico, since I already used it for my other keyboard projects (check it [out](https://github.com/geg-tech/biblicallyaccuratekeyboard) and star it now pls). I _kinda_ don't like the green color for it, but I'll try to find a copy of it in a different color on Aliexpress.

Since I'm going with a 75% keyboard, I'll need 82 keys in total. I plan on having two knobs on my keeb, so I'll be replacing one of the keys (top right one that's not del) with a knob, as well as an extra one on the side, bringing up my total to 83.
* i know i said i didn't want extra space on the outside but whatever 

I'll also add a screen and (hopefully) some RGB
* I say hopefully since finding the LEDs I want for my keeb (SK6812 mini) on aliexpress with a relatively trustworthy seller will be hard (at least from my experience)
* I _could_ get away with using full size RGB LEDs, but they're gonna be harder to fit on the PCB
